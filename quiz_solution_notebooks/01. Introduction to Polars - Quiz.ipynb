    "1. Rust - correct - Polars is implemented in Rust. It also has bindings in other languages, all of which use the underlying Rust implementation. See “Introduction to Polars.”\n",

    "1. Data from the same column is placed close together in memory. - correct - Exactly! Modern analytics use cases usually involve column-oriented actions, so having data from the same column close together helps Apache Arrow to optimize for OLAP. See “Apache Arrow: A Brief Intro.”\n",
    "2. Data from the same row is placed close together in memory. - incorrect - This would apply to online transaction processing (OLTP), but Apache Arrow is optimized for OLAP. See “Apache Arrow: A Brief Intro.”\n",
    "3. The data's storage location is close to the data's processing location. - incorrect - This is an interesting design consideration that differs across distributed computing tools like Hadoop and Spark, but it's not relevant here. See “Apache Arrow: A Brief Intro.”\n",
    "4. Data gets sorted before processing. - incorrect - How data is sorted isn't relevant to how the Apache Arrow memory model is optimized for column-oriented OLAP use cases. See “Apache Arrow: A Brief Intro.”"
